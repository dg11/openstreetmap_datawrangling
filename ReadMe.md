My project for Udacity's Data Wrangling Course.

I chose the SQL route.

See the "austin" folder for the notebooks containing the actual project.

Under the "austin" folder, there are two versions of part 1. p3_wrangle_openstreetmap_1_audit_short_version.ipynb contains the short version of p3_wrangle_openstreetmap_1.ipynb
